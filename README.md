# SetTracker

SetTracker is a full-stack application designed specifically for strength training enthusiasts. It facilitates the tracking of individual training sets and the grouping of exercises into customized workout sessions.

## Problem Statement
Traditional strength training progress is often tracked using a physical journal, which can become cumbersome and inefficient. For instance, if you're doing bench presses regularly, you have to manually flip through pages to find previous records, which is time-consuming. SetTracker eliminates this hassle by digitalizing the tracking process, enabling users to effortlessly access historical data, search for specific exercises, and manage workouts with date and timestamp functionalities.

## Technologies Used
**Frontend**
- **React Native**: A framework for building native apps using React.
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Asynchronous state management library
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend server.
- **React Native Paper**: Collection of customizable and production-ready components for React Native

**Backend**
- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Azure Function App**: Serverless computing service offered by Azure
- **CosmosDB**: Fully managed NoSQL, relational, and vector database.
